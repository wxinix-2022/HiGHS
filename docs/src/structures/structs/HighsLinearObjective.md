# HighsLinearObjective

A linear objective for a model is communicated via an instance of the HighsLinearObjective structure

- weight: Scalar of type double - The weight of this objective when blending 
- offset: Scalar of type double - The offset of this objective
- coefficients: Vector of type double - The coefficients of this objective
- abs\_tolerance: Scalar of type double - The absolute tolerance on this objective when performing lexicographic optimization 
- rel\_tolerance: Scalar of type double - The relative tolerance on this objective when performing lexicographic optimization 
- priority: Scalar of type HighsInt - The priority of this objective when performing lexicographic optimization
